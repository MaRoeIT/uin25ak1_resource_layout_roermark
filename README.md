**NB!** The site styling isn't optimized for lower screen width than 1200px.<br>
**NB!** The w3c validator service detects one warning since the article tag lacks heading,<br>
this fixes itself when the JavaScript code adds content to the site on initialization.
---

Before initialization:
```html
<article id="ResourceContent"></article>
```
After initialization:
```html
<h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Some text..............</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="SomeLink.com">SomeLink name</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="SomeLink.com">SomeLink name</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="SomeLink.com">SomeLink name</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
```

I have not taken inføring i programmering, and have learnt JavaScript by helping other students since i have quite a good grasp on other programming languages.
I have used Intelisense for discovering most of the inbuilt functionality that JavaScript offers that i haven't used in other languages.
For refferance on syntax i have used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and the cheatSheets created in inføring i programmering that i have lent from another student.
